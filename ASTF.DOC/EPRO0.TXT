			 AstroFORTH
		software development system


     The AstroFORTH  system  is  an  implementation  of  the
FORTH-83 language  standard for personal computers, equipped
with the  i8086/i8088 microprocessors. The AstroFORTH system
may  be  used  to  design  software  of  different  kinds  -
operating  systems,  workstations  intellectual  interfaces,
interactive   information    management   systems,   on-line
tutorials, computer games etc.
     The system  operates under the control of the operating
system MS  DOS or  its analogues. For the system to work one
needs 128K  main memory  (without taking into account memory
for operating  system and  resident software), a floppy/hard
disk drive,  a colour/monochrome  display controller and (if
required) a  printer. AstroFORTH uses standard mechanisms of
operating system for external memory access, which allows to
manipulate   with programs  and data,  keeping	in  external
files  of   the  FORTH-system	by  using  standard  MS  DOS
utilities.
     In addition  to standard  primitives  of  the  FORTH-83
language the  nucleus of the AstroFORTH system contains user
window interface  (window control  system),  interface	with
operating  system,   access   procedures   to	video	RAM,
intersegment memory access and other tools.
     The AstroFORTH  system includes  full implementation of
the FORTH-83 standard and following software tools:

   - fullscreen editing of the FORTH input text;
   - text editor for screen files with fullscreen editing;
   - dynamically loaded FORTH-assembler, which provides code
     generation for  the i8086/i8088  processor and  for the
     i8087 coprocessor;
   - time-sharing execution of FORTH-definitions;
   - access procedures	to the	DOS  file  system  via	file
     handles;
   - interactive FORTH-debugger;
   - subsystem of  the interactive  "help", allowing  to get
     detailed descriptions of FORTH-definitions.
