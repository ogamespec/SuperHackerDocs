			AstroFORTH++
		software development system


     The AstroFORTH  system  is  an  implementation  of  the
FORTH-83 language  standard for personal computers, equipped
with the  i8086/i8088 microprocessors. The AstroFORTH system
may  be  used  to  design  software  of  different  kinds  -
operating  systems,  workstations  intellectual  interfaces,
interactive   information    management   systems,   on-line
tutorials, computer games etc.
     The AstroFORTH+  system contains  AstroFORTH system,  a
number of software packages, providing users with additional
facilities (computer  graphic, melodies  generation,  float-
point arithmetic etc.), instrumental and target compilers.
     Instrumental compiler  is developped to design extended
and non-standard  FORTH-systems.  Created  programs  support
dictionary structure  and  may	use  all  FORTH-83  language
standard facilities.
     Target  compiler	is  developped	 to  design  compact
programs, not supporting dictionary structure and using only
basic  mechanisms   of	the   FORTH-83	language   standard.
Programs, compiled  by target  compiler, may  use AstroFORTH
enhancements, including  user window  interface and  some of
AstroFORTH+  packages.	 Program  assembly  is	carryed  out
automatically,	 created   program   contains	only   those
definitions, which are used when executed.
