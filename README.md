# SuperHackerDocs

The presented documentation could be found on "SUPER HACKER" discs distributed in the post-Soviet space.

This documentation is a collection of information about vintage technologies from the late 90's. In the absence of the Internet, such discs and BBS were the only source of information for Russian programmers.

Due to expiration period, the submitted documentation is unlikely to violate any rights, therefore I post it purely for historical purposes. Perhaps someone will cause bouts of nostalgia :smile:
