This archive contains programs to convert the MSDOS interrupt list into
hypertext databases for a number of popular hypertext help systems.
These programs have been contributed by others; I have not tested them
because I do not own any of the help systems for which they produce
databases.  If you have problems, please contact the author of the
program with which you experienced difficulties.  Some of these programs
are fairly old, and will thus not take advantage of recent enhancements
to the list's format.

INTERVUE.EXE, INTLIST.ICO, and IV.BAT are the files for the
public-domain interrupt list viewer from Hackensack.  IV.BAT is a
wrapper which ensures that the necessary index file exists before
invoking INTERVUE.  The interrupt list is nearing the limits of
INTERVUE v1.5's capabilities, and a new version is planned (hopefully
it will be included in INTER43).  INTPRINT has already been enhanced to
support the upcoming version of INTERVUE.

In addition, the source code for INTPRINT, INT.COM, and the Epsilon
extension code I use while editing the list are included in this
archive.

Not included here because it is rather large and is distributed
separately by the author, is IL2HDK by Ron Loewy, a conversion program
to put the interrupt list into Help Development Kit format, from which
it can be converted into about a dozen different formats, including
WinHelp, QuickHelp, Borland THELP, OS/2 IPF, POPHELP, and DESQview/X
help. At the time of this writing, the current version was 3.1
(IL2HDK31).
