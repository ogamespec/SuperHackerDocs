Program: EASY-NET is a shareware two-machine serial-port network
--------N-2F8000-----------------------------
INT 2F - Nanosoft, Inc. TurboNET server - INSTALLATION CHECK
	AX = 8000h
Return: AL = FFh if installed
	    BX = CS of resident code
	    CX = ??? (03FCh)
Program: TurboNET is a NetBIOS-based file redirector and server; a
	  demonstration version may be downloaded from Nanosoft's BBS

--------t-2F8000-----------------------------
INT 2F - CS_TSR specification - TSR INSTALLATION CHECK
	AX = 8000h
	DS:SI -> 4-byte CS_TSR signature (11h 43h 53h 10h)
Return: AL = status
	    00h no CS_TSR-compliant TSRs installed
	    01h installed, but signature did not match
	    FFh installed, signature matches
		ES:DI -> resident process block (see #1473) of last installed
			  TSR (if DS:SI pointed at signature on entry)
Program: the CS_TSR specification is a standardized TSR interface by Compact
	  Soft group in Kiev, Ukraine
Desc:	determine whether any CS_TSR-compliant TSRs are installed on the
	  selected multiplex number
Range:	AH=80h to AH=FFh
SeeAlso: AX=8001h"CS_TSR",AX=8002h"CS_TSR",AX=8003h"CS_TSR"

Format of CS_TSR process block:
Offset	Size	Description	(Table 1473)
 00h  4 BYTEs	CS_TSR signature 11h 43h 53h 10h
 04h	BYTE	INT 2F multiplex number
 05h	WORD	virtual process handle (unique among loaded TSRs)
 07h  2 BYTEs	version (binary minor version, then major version)
 09h	WORD	PSP segment of TSR
 0Bh	DWORD	pointer to ASCIZ program name
 0Fh  3 BYTEs	program creation date (day, month, year)
 12h  3 BYTEs	process start time (seconds, minutes, hours)
 15h  3 BYTEs	process start date (day, month, year)
--------F-2F8000DX0000-----------------------
INT 2F - FaxBIOS interface - INSTALLATION CHECK
	AX = 8000h
	DX = 0000h
	DI = 0000h
Return: AL = FFh if installed
	DX:DI -> signature "FaxBiosjpc"
Range:	AH=80h to AH=FFh, selected by scanning multiplex numbers for signature
SeeAlso: AH=2Ah,AX=80FBh
--------N-2F8001-----------------------------
INT 2F - Nanosoft, Inc. TurboNET server - ???
	AX = 8001h
	DS:SI -> 16-byte buffer for ???
Return: AH = status
	    00h successful
	    01h error (TurboNET busy)
Note:	makes NetBIOS calls
--------t-2F8001-----------------------------
INT 2F - CS_TSR specification - GET HANDLE (TSR-SPECIFIC INSTALLATION CHECK)
	AX = 8001h
	DS:SI -> ASCIZ signature string for desired TSR (see #1474)
Return: BX = process handle or 0000h if specified TSR not installed
	ES:DI -> process block for TSR (see #1473) if BX<>0000h
Note:	A widely-available copy of ASCII billing itself as "ASCII 2.OO by
	  Nick Zaikin Jr." is in fact a hacked copy of the Compact Soft
	  ASCII v4.23 which is identical except for the changed attribution
	  and version (in fact, some instances of "4.23" were missed); the
	  hacked copy requires the signature string
	  "ASCII 2.OO by Nick Zaikin Jr." instead of the unhacked version's
	  simple signature "ASCII"
SeeAlso: AX=8000h"CS_TSR",AX=8002h"CS_TSR"

(Table 1474)
Values for CS_TSR signature strings:
 "ASCII"	ASCII, a popup ASCII table with character input
 "Halculator"	HALC, a 32-bit RPN WYSIWIH calculator with undo and ptr support
 "AntiTurbo"	AT!, an intelligent system slow-down utility
--------t-2F8002-----------------------------
INT 2F - CS_TSR specification - GET PROCESS BLOCK BY PROCESS HANDLE
	AX = 8002h
	BX = process handle for TSR (see AX=8001h"CS_TSR")
Return: ES:DI -> process block for specified TSR (see #1473)
		unchanged if no match for process handle
Note:	This function is used to allocate a process handle when the TSR
	  installs itself, by setting ES:DI to point at something other than
	  a CS_TSR process block's signature string and iterating through the
	  possible process handles (0001h to FFFFh) until ES:DI is returned
	  unchanged
SeeAlso: AX=8000h"CS_TSR",AX=8001h"CS_TSR",AX=8003h"CS_TSR"

	AX = 8003h
	BX = process handle for TSR (see AX=8001h"CS_TSR")
	other registers vary by TSR
Return: vary by TSR, unchanged if not supported
Program: the CS_TSR specification is a standardized TSR interface by Compact
	  Soft group in Kiev, Ukraine

Notes:	This call provides a mechanism for TSRs to install permanent

Notes:	this call requests execution of the command which a previous call to
	  AX=AE00h indicated was resident
	APPEND hooks this call
BUG:	Novell DOS 7.0's COMMAND.COM will attempt to run a disk program with
	  the indicated name even if the returned length byte is zero, because
	  the register used to flag this case is clobbered without first
	  checking it.	The workaround is to set the command name buffer to
	  "REM" followed by enough blanks to pad out the original command's
	  length, which will also work with MS-DOS 6.

INT 2F U - network - RELINK KEYBOARD HANDLER
	AX = B808h
	ES:BX -> INT 09 handler network should call after it finishes INT 09
Notes:	this call replaces the address to which the network software chains on
	  an INT 09 without preserving the original value.  This allows a prior
	  handler to unlink, but does not allow a new handler to be added
	  such that the network gets the INT 09 first unless the new handler
	  completely takes over INT 09 and never chains.
	this function is called by the DOS 3.2 KEYBxx.COM

	  or an IRET if the chaining address is 0000h:0000h
	if the program wishes to remove itself before the window is closed, it
	  should call the DVeop entry point with the previously returned

	  array while inside a critical section (see INT 15/AX=101Bh).	Only
	  those records with bit 7 of the first byte set are valid.
