    The  program  INTHELP  converts  the  raw  Interrupt file into an input
file  for  the  Object  Professional  MAKEHELP  program to create a POPHELP
database.

    The command line syntax is :
  c:> INTHELP [inputfile-name] [outputfile-name]

    The  square  brackets  mean  that  the  filenames  are optional. If you
don't specify them,  the program will prompt you for the missing name(s).

    From  the  5/91  list, it creates a 1.2M source file for MAKEHELP which
then creates a help database of about 951K.

Hint : run the MAKEHELP utility with the /q qualifier because some of
       the topics cross-reference themselves (in the 5/91 list).
       These topics are : - INT 10 / AX=4400
                          - INT 67 / AX=4700
                          - INT 67 / AX=0E07
                          - INT 6A / AX=D000

    The created help database has 3 levels of hierarchy and the correct
connections, including cross-references.

    There are two versions of this utility using the same command line
conventions : INTHELP and FANCYHELP. The only difference between the two
is the user-interface.
