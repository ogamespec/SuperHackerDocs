  Note to shareware version:
  Chapters 9 and 10 and the appendices are not included in the shareware 
version of the Reference. This isn't CrippleWare; what you have is complete 
and useful (though perhaps slightly out of date, depending on how old this
archive is when you get it). The deletions were to keep the file size down 
around 200k for easier transmission.
