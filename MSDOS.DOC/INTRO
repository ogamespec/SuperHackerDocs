 This book is a technical reference. It is NOT a tutorial. Hopefully, this 
book is what you'll reach for when you want find out what Peter Norton or the 
"official" references glossed over.

 This manual is intended to replace the various (expensive) references needed to
program for the DOS environment, that stack of magazines threatening to take
over your work area, and those odd tables and charts you can never find when you
need them.

 The various Microsoft and IBM publications and references don't always have the
same information. This has caused some consternation about the "undocumented"
features to be found in DOS. In general, if a call doesn't appear in the IBM
DOS Technical Reference it is considered "undocumented" although it may be in
common use.

 Microsoft's offical policy toward DOS has been to put the burden of documenting
and supporting their product to their vendors. Microsoft will not answer any
questions concerning DOS directly since they don't officially support it. This
leaves what information IBM and other OEMs (DEC, Zenith, et al) have chosen to
publish, and the information obtained from programmers who've poked around
inside it.

 Now that Microsoft is selling MSDOS 3.2 and 3.3 as Microsoft products they seem
to be dragging their feet over whether they will have to support the generic
version since it doesn't have an OEM name on it anymore. In view of their push
to OS/2 (OS/2! Just Say No!) further support of DOS seems unlikely.

 The information here is valid for DOS 2.x and 3.x. Where there are differences
between the two versions there are notes in the text. No great effort was
expended on DOS 1.x or networking features.

 As I write this there is still considerable furor over incompatibilities with 
DOS 4.0. Since a Technical Reference for 4.0 isn't availible yet, I don't have 
a whole lot of info on it.

 When I started writing this book, it was originally for my own personal use. 
Then I began expanding it with the idea of getting it published, since at that 
time there was *nothing* in print like it. If I had managed to send it off to 
the publishers early enough, I would have had it made. As it was I lost six 
months having a nice steel rod put in my leg, after being run over by a car,
and half a dozen similar books were published by then, and nobody was
interested in mine. Six months is a long time in the PC world.

 That's why I'm uploading this file as "user-supported." It gives me a chance 
to recoup a few bucks for the year or so I've been working on this thing, and
it gives some advantages that a printed book can't - first, you can load it on
your hard disk and use Vern Buerg's LIST or SideKick to scan through text. You
can grab a peice of something and paste it into a document, etc. If you help
support the PC Programmer's Reference you will always have the latest version 
availible; you can't "upgrade" books.

 A project this size takes a LOT of time and effort. I've tried to verify as
much of the information I've received as I could, but there's just too much for
absolute certainty.

 If you find any typos, incorrect information, or want to see something else, 
let me know. If you have any more detailed information on something, PLEASE let
me know!

 As is common these days, I have to make a "Notice of Disclaimer". I take no 
responsibility for anything, and if anything you do with this book ruins you 
for life or makes your dog bite you, or anything else, that's just tough.

 I hope you find much use for this reference. It was a trip to write, too.

 The information presented here was gathered from megabytes of files found on 
BBS systems, conversations on a dozen different BBS systems, correspondence,
and every reference book I could get my hands on. On occaision, a number of
prestigious references didn't agree with each other. Where this has happened, I
have used the latest references. There is too much information here for me to 
verify every fact personally. I have used my own judgement as to the 
reliability of the sources.
