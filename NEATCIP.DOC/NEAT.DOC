                
               Introduction

                The New Enhanced AT (NEAT[(r)]) CHIPSet[tm] from Chips &
                Technologies has brought many of the memory and performance
                features of an 80386 system to the less expensive 80286 CPU.
                In addition, it offers features not found in any previous
                personal computer system.  Among these, user-controllable
                shadow RAM, bus timing, wait state control and LIM EMS 4.0
                emulation, all in a jumperless configuration.

                To control all of these features, a ROM-based Setup routine
                stores appropriate values into CMOS registers contained in
                three of the NEAT[(r)] chips.  To simplify configuration for
                new users, a minimal setup routine is accessible under the
                "Easy NEAT CHIPSet Register Setup" option.  This
                "stripped-down" setup contains all of the mandatory setup
                information and is fully detailed in the JE3010 and JE3011
                Owner's Manuals.

                To access all of the features of the NEAT[(r)] CHIPSet[tm], the
                user will have to be acquainted with the NEAT[(r)] registers
                themselves.  These registers are accessible under the "Advanced
                NEAT[(r)] CHIPSet[tm] Register Setup" option and are fully
                explained in this supplement.  Before consulting this, read the
                Owner's Manual and complete the installation and setup of your
                new computer system.


                WARNING!  It is conceivable that contradictory settings may be
                stored in the CMOS registers that can prevent the system from
                booting.  In this event, attempt the re-initialization
                procedure that follows several times before calling for
                technical assistance.  If you are still unsuccessful, please
                refer to the Obtaining Assistance section of this document.
                ATTEMPTING TO RE-INITIALIZE THESE SETTINGS EITHER BY REMOVING
                THE BATTERY OR CMOS DEVICES CAN RESULT IN PERMANENT DAMAGE TO
                THE MOTHERBOARD AND WILL VOID ANY WARRANTY.




CMOS Reset      To re-initialize the NEAT[(r)] CMOS registers, follow this
                procedure:

                [C1] Turn on the computer
                [C1] Wait 20 seconds
                [C1] Press and hold down the [Key: ] key
                [C1] Press the reset button for at least 3 seconds
                [C1] When the memory test starts, release the [Key: ] key.

                This procedure will reinitialize the CMOS setup and the
                Extended CMOS settings to their default values.  Of course, the
                Extended CMOS Setup and possibly the CMOS Setup will need to be
                run again to set the proper values.



                
               Memory Types

                The NEAT[(r)] 80286 motherboard can utilize its RAM in four
                different configurations:  base, shadow, extended and expanded
                (EMS).  As more memory is added to it (up to eight megabytes),
                this flexibility increases.

                If 1024Kb (1Mb) has been installed on it, the residual 384Kb
                above 640Kb can be used for either shadow RAM or Extended
                memory.


Base            The memory addresses from 0Kb to 640Kb comprise the base memory
                of the system.  This is the memory that DOS manages and is
                sometimes referred to as "conventional memory". Some
                applications require the full amount of base memory.


Shadow          In all IBM software compatible computers, the addresses from
                640Kb to 1024Kb are reserved for the system BIOS ROMs and ROMs
                of I/O expansion cards.  In systems with 1024Kb of RAM, the
                memory addressed from 640Kb to 1024Kb would normally be lost.

                The NEAT[(r)] Motherboards have the ability to copy the
                contents of the BIOS ROMs into this unused RAM, disable the
                ROMs and run the BIOS routines from RAM.  This process is
                referred to as "shadowing."  The main advantage to the shadow
                feature is the increase in system performance.  Most ROMs have
                access times of only 200 to 400ns.  Since these boards
                typically operate with memory faster than 80ns, the shadowed
                BIOS routines can attain a 200 to 400% increase in performance.

                If shadow RAM is enabled during the Extended Setup procedure,
                the following events will take place after a reset or power on:


                1) After the POST, the AMI BIOS looks at the Extended Setup
                parameters and finds that you have shadow features enabled.

                2) It looks at the BIOS locations that are to be shadowed.

                3) It then takes each BIOS (at the selected locations) and
                copies their complete contents into RAM addressed at the same
                location.

                4) The BIOS ROMs are then disabled.  Their operations are then
                executed from shadow RAM.

                Note:  Shadow RAM cannot be enabled when the "memory
                relocating" feature in advanced setup is used.


Extended        The memory addresses above 1024Kb are referred to as extended
                memory.  While the 80286 CPU is capable of using this memory,
                DOS and other PC applications can only address 1024Kb.
                Therefore, most applications are unable to take advantage of
                extended memory.  Some examples of programs that can utilize
                extended memory are:  VDISK, VCACHE, Framework II and AutoCAD.

                The NEAT[(r)] Motherboard takes any memory that is not used for
                EMS (Expanded Memory Specification), and uses it for Extended
                memory with the starting address beginning at 1024Kb.

                If 1024Kb is installed, the 384Kb of memory that is above the
                640Kb base may be used for extended memory.  To select this
                option, set bit 6 on at register 6BH in the advanced setup
                program.  If more than 1Mb is available, DO NOT use this
                option.

                Note:  The "memory relocating" feature cannot be enabled when
                the "shadow" feature is used.



Expanded        The NEAT[(r)] Motherboards conform to the Lotus/Intel/Microsoft
(EMS)           Expanded Memory Specification version 4.0 (LIM EMS 4.0).
                Expanded memory is not addressed as part of the system RAM.
                Instead, it is partitioned from the rest of the RAM and is
                accessed in pages by programs that support LIM EMS 4.0.  Note
                that LIM EMS 4.0 is downward-compatible with older LIM EMS
                specifications (ie. LIM EMS 3.2).

                RAM that is partitioned for EMS is removed from the available
                extended memory, reducing the total RAM displayed at POST.  The
                interface between applications software and EMS is a software
                driver that is provided on diskette with the motherboard.

                Some examples of programs that can utilize expanded memory
                are:  Lotus 1-2-3 v2.01, Freelance Plus v3.0, Manuscript;
                Microsoft File, Word, Works; Ashton-Tate dBase III/IV,
                Framework II; Software Publishing Corp. Professional File;
                Borland Sidekick Plus and AutoCAD.


Examples        A system with 8192Kb of RAM could be configured with the
                following memory arrangement:  640Kb of conventional memory
                with all shadow features enabled.  6144Kb (6M) of expanded
                memory, leaving 1024Kb that is automatically configured as
                extended memory.

                With this configuration, the POST memory test will count to
                1664Kb which is 640Kb conventional plus 1024Kb extended.  The
                384Kb is used for shadow and expanded memory addressing, plus
                the actual 6Mb set aside for expanded memory, is not included
                in the POST memory count.  The BIOS tests the 384Kb RAM
                separately, while the expanded memory is tested by using one of
                the options offered by the driver software (explained later).



Alternate       While there are a variety of non-DOS operating systems (ie.
Operating       Xenix, PC/MOS, etc.) which we will not discuss, there are some
Systems         alternate operating environments that overlay DOS giving the
                user additional functionality.  These include Microsoft's
                Windows/286 and Quarterdeck's DesqView.  These operating
                systems load from DOS and assume control of the system allowing
                advanced windowing, applications control and memory management
                features.  Both Windows/286 and DesqView utilize base, extended
                and expanded memory for optimum performance.  Follow the
                recommendations of the software manufacturer for configuring
                the memory to achieve the best performance.  Typically, this
                calls for a small amount of extended memory and as much
                expanded memory as possible.

                
               Extended Setup

                During each setup, use [Key: ][Key: ][Key: ]
                [Key: ] to move the highlight bar.  Use [Key: ] or
                [Key: ] to change parameters.  Each setup screen will
                display a window describing each option.  Use the [Key: ]
                key to exit the current setup screen.


Entering        Reset or power up the system.  The system will go through POST
Extended Setup  and display the size of the memory being tested.  Note that
                this test can be bypassed by pressing the [Key: ] key.
                This option is useful when the memory on the system is quite
                large, although It is a good idea to let the test count
                through.

                Immediately after the memory test, the following prompt will
                appear on the screen:

                Press <DEL> key to run SETUP/EXTD-SET

                Press the [Key: ] key to get into the Setup Mode.  Note
                that [Key: ] key will initiate the setup mode only when
                the above message is present on the screen.  A moment after the
                [Key: ] is pressed, this menu will appear:

                EXIT FOR BOOT
                RUN CMOS SETUP
                RUN XCMOS SETUP

                Use [Key: ][Key: ] and highlight "RUN XCMOS SETUP"
                and press [Key: ].  The Extended Setup screen appears as
                follows:

                  VIDEO BIOS SHADOW AT C4000H,16Kb ->0


                Shadowing the main ROM BIOS will improve overall system speed.
                Shadowing the video ROM BIOS will offer a 20% to 30% increase
                in video performance.  You must have a minimum of 1Mb of RAM
                and the Relocate Option must be disabled (82C212, 6BH, set bit
                6 to 0).  This may cause the screen to flicker with some
                systems.  If any video problems are encountered, turn off the
                video shadow feature.

                Note:  The "shadow" features cannot be enabled if the "memory
                relocating" feature is used.

                Press [Key: ] to return to the main menu.


Advanced NEAT   Highlight "Advanced NEAT CHIPSet Register Setup" and press
[(r)] Register  [Key: ].  The system will warn you that improper setup
Setup           may prevent the computer from operating.  If this occurs, refer
                to the CMOS Reset section at the beginning of this supplement.

                Next, the display will change to a graphic depiction of the
                CMOS registers as shown in the following diagrams.  The first
                diagram shows default settings for boards with the 82C212.  The
                second diagram shows default settings for boards with the
                82C212B.


                A description of the currently selected bit's function will
                appear on the right portion of the screen.  Any permissible
                values will also be displayed.  All bits marked as "R"eserved
                cannot be changed.  For clarity, we will discuss the options
                available at each bit in the following sections.

               82C211

                The 82C211 Bus Controller consists of the following functional
                sub-modules:  Reset and Shut Down Logic, Clock Generation and
                Selection, CPU State, Bus State, Bus Arbitration and Refresh
                Logic, NMI Generation Logic, Numeric Coprocessor Interface.

                This determines the source of the PROCCLK signal and should be
                set for CLK2IN.  This will divide the CLK signal by two.  For
                example, the 32MHz oscillator will be divided by two, providing
                a 16MHz timing signal for the 80286 processor.

1,0             Bus Clock (BCLK) Source Select

                00:  BCLK = CLK2IN/2
                01:  BCLK = CLK2IN
                10:  BCLK = ATCLK
                11:  Reserved


                This option selects the bus clock (BCLK) source.  Default is
                CLK2IN/2.  In a system with a 32MHz oscillator, CLK2IN will be
                16MHz and the resulting bus speed will be 8MHz (CLK2IN/2).
                When this option is selected, you have an advantage of being
                able to switch the system speed down twice.  Once with the
                keyboard (system switches to 8MHz), and once with the turbo
                switch (system switches to 4MHz).  This can come in handy when
                some software needs to run near IBM-PC speed.

                Changing this bit to 01 would result in a bus speed of 16MHz.
                Attempts to change the clock speed via keyboard, will lock up
                the system.  The bus speed cannot be faster than the system
                speed.  Also, be aware that most AT expansion cards are
                incapable of exceeding 10MHz.  This option is most useful when
                the source oscillator has been replaced.

                you get a 00 and you have an 82C212B chip, you should execute a
                CMOS Reset as explained at the beginning of this supplement.


65H             ROM Configuration Register RB1


                In most cases all Shadow RAM should be set from the other menu
                "ENABLE/DISABLE VIDEO AND MAIN BIOS SHADOW".  However, if you
                have a special application, you may set specific bits here.

                NOTE:  Please use caution when using this option.  Many ROMs
                will have problems.  Hard disk drive controller card ROMs, for
                example, should not be shadowed.  Other ROMs (i.e. a Floppy
                controller card ROM) can possibly be shadowed without
                problems.  If you have any operation problems with a ROM you
                have shadowed, disable this option.


                If you have a BIOS ROM that is located at a specific address
                and you wish to provide shadow RAM for this BIOS, you must set
                three bits:

                [C1] Set one of the RAM bits from register 65H (bit 7, 6, 5 or
                4) within the address range of the BIOS to be shadowed, to the
                Read Only/Write Protected state.

                [C1] Disable one of the ROM bits from register 65H (bit 3, 2,
                1, or 0) within the address range of the BIOS to be shadowed.

                [C1] Enable one (or more, depending on the BIOS size) of the
                bits from registers 67H to 69H.  The first bit enabled should
                be equal to the starting address of the BIOS to be shadowed.
                If the BIOS to be shadowed occupies an address area larger than
                the area of one of these bits, you must enable the next
                consecutive bit (or bits) until the complete BIOS address area
                is shadowed.

                0:   DRAMS used in Normal Mode
                1:   DRAMS used in Page/Interleaved

                The JE3010 and JE3011 use an advanced memory accessing scheme
                incorporating both Paged and Interleaved memory techniques.
                These methods are available when

                two or four banks of RAM are installed in the motherboard.
                This option will permit the installation of slower RAM (i.e.
                150 or 120ns) to operate in the motherboard.  When either two
                or four banks are installed, paging and interleaving can both
                occur, resulting in greatly improved memory performance.  These
                techniques require RAM chips that have a CAS before RAS
                design.  There are no provisions for paging or interleaving
                when only one bank or only three banks of RAM are installed.

                This feature can only be enabled if you have two or four banks
                of memory filled with the same size DRAM.  This option is not
                valid if you have only one or three banks of DRAM or if your
                banks contain mixed size memory (ie. 256Kb and 64Kb).


6               Relocate DRAM at 640Kb to above 1Mb

                0:   Do not relocate RAM (Reserve for SHADOW)
                1:   Relocate 80000H-FFFFFH to 100000H-11FFFFH

                This option allows only a 1Mb system to take the 384Kb of
                memory (located between 640Kb and 1Mb) and remap it to be
                addressed above 1Mb so that it can be used as "extended"
                memory.

                If the motherboard has more than 1Mb installed, this bit should
                be set to 0.  If not, you will be remapping this RAM onto other
                RAM.

                NOTE:  You will not be able to enable any shadow RAM features
                if you choose to relocate RAM.


5               RAM Access Wait States

                0:   Zero Wait States
                1:   One Wait State

                In non-interleaved operation, 80ns or faster DRAM is required
                for 0ws access.  In interleaved operation, 150ns or faster DRAM
                is all that is required.

                0:   EMS Disabled

                This option allows extended memory to be remapped as expanded
                memory (EMS).  Therefore, you must have at least 1.5Mb to use
                this feature.

                NOTE:  Please read the section "Setting up EMS" located later
                in this manual for a complete step by step procedure for
                completely setting up EMS memory.

                1:   4 Way Interleave

                Only with the 82C212B, 4-way interleaving is possible when all
                four banks are filled with the same RAM type (i.e. banks 0 and
                1 filled with 1Mb chips AND banks 2 and 3 filled with 1Mb
                SIPPs), allowing for more performance.  4-way interleaving can
                be enabled by setting register 6CH (bit 4) to a 1.  This bit is
                reserved on the regular 82C212.

                If all four memory banks contain the same size DRAM, select
                option 1.  If you have only two memory banks of DRAM or if
                banks 0 and 1 do not contain the same size memory as banks 2
                and 3 select option 0.

                The default of 0100 should be fine for most applications.
                Ensure that none of the four selected addresses conflicts with
                other peripherals in your system.  For example, hard and floppy
                controllers often use C0000H, C4000H, C8000H or CC000H.

                The default should be fine for most applications.  Ensure that
                neither of the two I/O addresses selected conflicts with other
                peripherals in your system.  For example, COM4: is usually
                2E8H.

Setting up EMS  There are many steps that need to be completed in order to set
                up EMS memory.  From the "Advanced NEAT CHIPSET Register Setup"
                screen, execute the following steps:

                [C1] Set EMS enable bit (Reg 6BH, bit 4).  This bit enables or
                disables the EMS memory function.

                [C1] Set EMS memory wait states (Reg 6BH, bits 3,2).  The
                default is 2 wait states.  Normally EMS memory wait states
                should be more than normal system RAM wait states.

                [C1] Set EMS base address (Reg 6DH, bits 7,6,5,4).  The default
                address area for standard EMS is D0000H to DFFFFH, however,
                other addresses may be specified.  If you have an application
                that requires you to change the EMS address, be sure you select
                a new address that is not used so that other items in the
                system will not conflict.

                [C1] Set EMS page I/O address (Reg 6DH, bits 3,2,1,0).  The
                default I/0 address is 208H/209H.  However, other I/O addresses
                may be specified.  If you have an application that requires you
                to change the I/O address, be sure you select a new address
                that is not used by other items in the system.

                [C1] You do not need to set the EMS page positions (Reg 6EH,
                bits 7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0).  You should leave all of these set to
                00.  The only time you would be required to change these is
                when you have other EMS RAM cards installed in the system.


                [C1] Set EMS memory size (Reg 6FH, bits 7,6,5).  This bit
                allows you to specify the amount of memory in your system that
                you want used as EMS.  That amount you select must be equal to
                the (total amount of RAM in your system) MINUS (1Mb and any
                Extended memory you want).  The first one meg of RAM must be
                used for 640Kb Base and 384Kb Shadow.  This is why you cannot
                enable EMS unless you have 1.5Mb of RAM or more installed.  Any
                RAM that is left over (not used for EMS, Base or Shadow) will
                be set up as Extended memory.

                [C1] Press [Key: ].  Highlight the "Write CMOS Registers
                and Exit" option and press [Key: ].

                [C1] Since the system now finds a new RAM size, the regular
                CMOS setup must be run.  Press [Key: ] to enter the set up
                choices screen.  Select "CMOS Setup" and make sure all
                parameters are correct.  You may not need to change anything;
                the system just needs to clarify the new RAM configuration.

                [C1] Save and exit from setup.  Boot the system.

                [C1] In order to complete the installation of EMS memory, a
                CONFIG.SYS file must be created or modified on your boot drive
                to include the EMS driver.  The diskette included with the
                motherboard contains two files: an EMS driver file and a
                document file.  The document file describes the options
                available for the EMS driver.  Copy both files to your boot
                drive.

                An example line in the CONFIG.SYS file would be:

                DEVICE=NEATEMM.SYS

                NOTE:  When inserting this command in your CONFIG.SYS file,
                make sure you insert it AFTER the "FILES=xx" and "BUFFERS=xx"
                commands.

                [C1] Reboot the system.  The CONFIG.SYS file is read by the
                system only during bootup.



Write CMOS      To save all parameters and reboot, highlight this option and
Registers and   press [Key: ].
Exit


Do Not Change   To discard all changes and reboot, highlight this option and
CMOS and Exit   press [Key: ].
