I got this from the OPTi data book.  Hopefully, there aren't too
many typos.

SYSC (82C493) Register Description, OPTi chipset 486SXWB

Ref:  OPTi-486SXWB PC/AT Chipset Preliminary Data Book
      Version 1.1, August 16, 1991


          There are twelve configuration registers in the 82C493 -
          REG1-REG12.  The registers are accessed through I/O ports 22H
          and 24H.  Location 22H is the "Index Address".  This address
          corresponds to the specific register which points to the
          required data value accessed through port 24H.  Thus,
          reading or writing to a specific register is a two step
          operation:

          1) write to I/O port 22H with the register index.

          2) write or read the data to or from I/O port 24H.

          Every access to port 24H must be preceded by a write of the
          index value to port 22H even if the same data register is
          being accessed.  After power up, the configuration registers
          assume default values.  All bits marked as Reserved must be
          programmed zero.

Here is some info on the 82C482 chip that was given to me by a friend.


          There are fourteen configuration registers in the 82C482_C -
          REG0-REG13.  The registers are accessed through IO ports 22H
          and 24H.  Location 22H is the "Index Address".  This address
          corresponds to the specific register which points to the
          required data value accessed through port 24H.  Thus,
          reading or writing to a specific register is a two step
          operation:

          1) write to I/O port 22H with the register index.

          2) write or read the data to or from I/O port 24H.

          Every access to port 24H must be preceded by a write of the
          index value to port 22H even if the same data register is
          being accessed.  After power up, the configuration registers
          assume default values.  All bits marked as Reserved must be
          programmed zero.
