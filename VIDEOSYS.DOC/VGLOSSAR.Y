Glossary


     This glossary includes some of the acronyms, abbreviations, buzzwords,
     engineering terms, and programming jargon that appear frequently
     throughout this book.

     80x86: Refers to all the processors in the Intel 8086 family. The IBM
     PCs and PS/2s all use one of these processors: 8086, 8088, 80286, or
     80386.

     active display: In a computer that contains two video subsystems and
     displays, the display to which a program sends its output.

     adapter: A modular, plug-in circuit that performs a specialized task
     such as generating video output. Well-known IBM PC video adapters
     include the MDA, CGA, HGC, EGA, and VGA Adapter.

     ANSI: American National Standards Institute. One of ANSI's many
     activities is to certify the standardization of programming tools,
     including languages (such as C and FORTRAN) and software interfaces
     (such as GKS).

     APA: All Points Addressable; describes graphics modes on the CGA, EGA,
     and Hercules graphics cards.

     API: Application Program Interface; a set of system-level routines
     that can be used in an application program for basic input and output,
     file management, and so on. In a graphics-oriented operating
     environment like Microsoft Windows, high-level support for video
     graphics output is part of the API.

     ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange. The ASCII
     standard specifies the basic character set used in IBM PCs and PS/2s.

     aspect ratio: The ratio of a video screen's width to its height. A
     typical IBM PC display has an aspect ratio of about 4:3. This term is
     also frequently used to describe pixels: If you think of a pixel as
     being rectangular, its aspect ratio would be the ratio of its width to
     height.

     attributes: Color, intensity, blinking, and other displayed
     characteristics of characters or pixels.

     BIOS: Basic Input/Output System; a low-level programming interface to
     the system's major I/O devices.

     bit plane: Video RAM containing formatted graphics data. In IBM video
     subsystems up to four bit planes can be addressed in parallel, with
     pixel values represented by the bits at corresponding locations in the
     bit planes.

     CGA: IBM's Color Graphics Adapter.

     character code: A numeric code associated with a character. The
     default ASCII character set used in all PCs and PS/2s comprises 256
     8-bit character codes.

     character matrix: The rectangular array of pixels in which characters
     are displayed on the screen. On IBM's Monochrome Display Adapter, each
     character is displayed in a character matrix that is 9 dots wide and
     14 dots high. On the Color Graphics Adapter, the character matrix is 8
     by 8.

     character set: A set of alphabetic and numeric characters and symbols.

     clipping: The process of determining which portions of a graphics
     image lie within a specified boundary.

     code page: A character set designed for use with computers. Each
     character in a code page is associated with a numeric code (such as an
     ASCII or EBCDIC code).

     CPU: Central Processing Unit, or the main processor in a computer. For
     example, the CPU is an Intel 8088 in PCs and an 80286 in PC/ATs.

     CRT: Cathode Ray Tube, or the picture tube you see when you look at
     your computer monitor. Some people refer to the entire monitor (the
     tube and its associated circuitry) as a CRT.

     CRTC: CRT Controller; a chip that controls a video display's timing
     signals.

     DGIS: Direct Graphics Interface Specification; a firmware graphics
     interface designed for video subsystems based on hardware graphics
     coprocessors.

     display: A video monitor.

     driver: Software or firmware that directly programs a specific
     hardware unit such as a video adapter or a printer.

     EBCDIC: Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code; the character-
     set implementation used on IBM mainframe computers.

     EGA: Enhanced Graphics Adapter.

     font: A description of the style and shapes of the characters in a
     character set.

     gate array: An integrated circuit that is partly prefabricated in its
     manufacture. An application-specific integrated circuit based on gate
     array technology can be less expensive and manufactured more rapidly
     than a custom integrated circuit.

     GKS: Graphical Kernel System; a standard high-level graphics
     interface.

     HGC: Hercules monochrome Graphics Card.

     HGC+ (HGC Plus): Hercules Graphics Card Plus; a monochrome video
     adapter like the HGC, but with a hardware character generator that
     can use RAM-based character sets.

     InColor: Hercules InColor Card; a 16-color version of the HGC+.

     latch: A hardware register external to the CPU and used for transient
     storage of data. For example, the EGA Graphics Controller uses four
     internal 8-bit latches to mediate data transfers between the bit
     planes and the CPU.

     LSI: Large Scale Integration.

     MCGA: Multi-Color Graphics Array; the video subsystem integrated into
     the PS/2 Model 30. Also, Memory Controller Gate Array, one of the
     components of the Model 30's video subsystem.

     MDA: IBM's Monochrome Display Adapter.

     MDPA: Monochrome Display and Printer Adapter; same as an MDA.

     monitor: The hardware that displays your computer's video output;
     comprises a CRT (cathode ray tube) and associated circuitry.

     MPA: Monochrome/Printer Adapter; same as an MDA.

     palette: A range of colors that can be displayed by a video subsystem.

     pel: A pixel.

     PGA: Professional Graphics Adapter; another name for IBM's PGC.

     PGC: IBM's Professional Graphics Controller.

     pixel: One dot or point in an image that is composed of a matrix of
     dots or points. The image on the video screen or on a page printed by
     a dot-matrix printer is composed of a large number of pixels. (The
     word "pixel" is a rough acronym for "picture element.")

     planar BIOS: BIOS routines found in ROM on the IBM PC or PS/2
     motherboard.

     PS/2: Personal System/2.

     PS/2 Display Adapter: A VGA-compatible IBM video adapter that may be
     used in a PC/XT, PC/AT, or PS/2 Model 30; commonly called "VGA
     Adapter."

     raster: The group of closely spaced horizontal scan lines that makes
     up a displayed video image.

     RGB: Red, Green, Blue; the three primary colors displayed by the
     monitors used in PC and PS/2 video subsystems. All other colors are
     blends of these three primaries. Video displays that are driven by
     separate red, green, and blue signals are often called RGB displays.

     scan line: One horizontal line traced across the screen by a CRT's
     electron beam.

     VDI: Computer Graphics Virtual Device Interface; a proposed ANSI
     standard high-level graphics interface. The Graphics Development
     Toolkit (GDT) sold by IBM and Graphics Software Systems is a
     commercial implementation of VDI.

     VGA: Video Graphics Array. People refer to the video subsystem
     integrated into the PS/2 Models 50, 60, and 80, as well as the IBM
     PS/2 Display Adapter, as the "VGA." Strictly speaking, however, the
     VGA is the circuitry in the video subsystem that performs the tasks of
     the CRT Controller, the Sequencer, the Graphics Controller, and the
     Attribute Controller. Most of this circuitry is contained in a single
     VLSI chip.

     VGA Adapter: The IBM PS/2 Display Adapter.

     video buffer: A buffer that contains the data that appears on the
     video display; variously known as a "display buffer," "frame buffer,"
     "refresh buffer," or "regenerative buffer."

     Video Control Data Area: Part of the Video Display Data Area. The
     block of RAM from 0040:0049 through 0040:0066 is Video Control Data
     Area 1; the block between 0040:0084 and 0040:008A is Video Control
     Data Area 2.

     Video Display Data Area: A global data area maintained by the ROM BIOS
     for storage of parameters related to its INT 10H video I/O routines.

     VLSI: Very Large Scale Integration.
