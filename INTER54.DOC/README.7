This is the last of seven archives containing the x86/MS-DOS Interrupt List,
Release 54.

This archive contains programs to convert the MS-DOS interrupt list
into hypertext databases for a number of popular hypertext help systems
(other than WinHelp, which is in a separate archive).  These programs
have been contributed by others; I have not tested most of them
personally because I do not own the help systems for which they produce
databases.  If you have problems, please contact the author of the
program with which you experienced difficulties.  Some of these
programs predate, and will thus not take advantage of, recent
enhancements to the list's format.  MOST OF THESE CONVERSION UTILITIES
ARE NOT STAND-ALONE PRODUCTS!  You must have the appropriate help
system compiler to create an actual hypertext database which can be
read by the help system; these are not included because they are
commercial products, usually distributed together with the hypertext
viewer.

Not included here because it is rather large and is distributed
separately by the author, is IL2HDK by Ron Loewy, a conversion program
to put the interrupt list into Help Development Kit format, from which
it can be converted into about a dozen different formats, including
WinHelp, QuickHelp, Borland THELP, OS/2 IPF, POPHELP, and DESQview/X
help. At the time of this writing, the current freeware version was 3.5
(IL2HDK35), with v4.3 included in the commercial version of HLPDK
(see http://www.hyperact.com/hact8.html).
