This is the fifth of seven archives containing the x/86MS-DOS Interrupt List,
Release 54.

This archive contains utility programs and viewers for the interrupt
list.  Most of these programs have been contributed by others; if you
have problems with a contributed program, please contact the author of
the program with which you experienced difficulties.

The viewers Interrupt Helper, Interrupt Summary, and IVIEW are offered
in this archive.  Interrupt Summary is designed to be
keystroke-compatible with INTERVUE (which is no longer included), while
offering additional functionality.  IVIEW is designed to conserve disk
space by not requiring any additional index files and by itself being
as compact as possible (under 2K!).

In addition, the source code for COMBINE, INTPRINT, INT.COM, and the
Epsilon extension code I use while editing the list are included in
this archive.  For this release only (as it will be spun off into a
separate package), I am also including a beta of PCICFG, my PCI device
information utility.
